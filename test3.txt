A teenager has appeared in court charged with attempted murder after a six-year-old boy was allegedly thrown from the 10th floor of the Tate Modern.

The child, who was found on a fifth-floor roof after he fell from the Tate's viewing platform on Sunday, is in a critical but stable condition.

He is a French national visiting London with his family.

A 17-year-old boy was remanded in custody until an appearance at the Old Bailey on Thursday.

There is no link between the suspect and the victim, police have said.

Emergency services were called to the gallery, in Bankside near London Bridge Station, at 14:40 BST on Sunday.

The Tate Modern opened in the disused power station on the River Thames in 2000, while the extension with the viewing platform was opened in 2016.

It was the UK's most popular tourist attraction in 2018 with 5.9 million visitors, according to the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions.
